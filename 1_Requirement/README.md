# Introduction
  A wiper speed control system regulates the wiper's operating speed in line with frequencies. A control signal is generated by digitally processing the pulse signal. The control signal is received by a wiper driving circuit, which adjusts the operational speed or time accordingly.
# Components
  MICROCONTROLLER BOARD STM32F4O7VG
# SoftwareRequired
  STMCUBE32 IDE
  
  # MICROCONTROLLER STM32F407VG FEATURES
  * The STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller contains a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 with FPU core, 1-Mbyte Flash memory, and 192-Kbyte RAM in a LQFP100 package.
  * Large-scale storage
  * Board power is supplied through USB or an external 5 V supply source
  * 3 V and 5 V external application power supply
  # Uses
  * Printing and scanning equipment, heat ventilation, air conditioning, and security systems all use this microcontroller.
  # Working principle
   Consider the microcontroller to be the automobile. When the button is pressed, the first led (red) turns on, the wiper starts, and the second led (blue) turns on at the appropriate rate. The third led (green) will turn on if the button is pressed again, and the wiper speed will be increased in contrast to the previous one. The fourth press will activate the fourth led (orange) and raise the wiper speed in accordance with the previous one. After the fifth click, the microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off.
 # WHO DISCOVERED WIPER SYSTEM
  In 1902, Mark Anderson created
 # WHAT IS WIPER SYSTEM
  Windscreen wipers are required for the driver to have a clear view, especially in modern high-speed vehicles.
 # WHY WIPER SYSTEM
  Maintain a clean windscreen that allows for a clear view at all times.
 # WHEN SHOULD USE WIPER SYSTEM
  The wipers clean the windshield of rain and snow, while the headlights improve visibility at night.
