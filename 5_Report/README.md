# Abstract
 One of the most crucial mechanisms in the vehicle is the wiper system. It's used to clean the vehicle's screen from water or any other liquid that has gotten on it. The wiper system has been modified. When the driver turns off the wiper on the old system, the wiper stops on the same position. When a modern wiper is turned off on any place on the screen, it returns to its previous position. I'm planning to build a wiper system control with a sensor and an actuator for this project.
